AustESE: Australian Electronic Scholarly Editing
================================================

The aim of the AustESE project is to develop a set of interoperable services to support the production of electronic scholarly editions by distributed collaborators in a Web 2.0 environment.

The project will integrate and build on existing open source tools and services including [nmerge](http://code.google.com/p/multiversiondocs/), [HRIT](http://hrit.etl.luc.edu/) and [CollateX](http://collatex.sourceforge.net/) 

The AustESE project is a collaboration between The University of Queensland, University of NSW, Curtin University, University of Sydney, Queensland University of Technology, Loyola University, Chicago and the University of Saskatchewan. 

It is funded through the [NeCTAR](http://nectar.org.au) e-Research Tools program for 2 years from 2012-2013.
